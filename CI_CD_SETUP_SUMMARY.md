### Configurable

- Thresholds in `pyproject.toml`
- Per-check configuration
- Ignore patterns for security
- Optional Slack integration
- Manual workflow triggers

## Maintenance

### Updating Baselines

When code quality genuinely improves:

1. Run checks: `python scripts/quality_gates.py --verbose`
2. Update `pyproject.toml` thresholds
3. Update GitHub workflow thresholds
4. Document changes in commit message
5. Create PR with baseline updates

### Adding New Checks

1. Add check to `scripts/quality_gates.py`
2. Add step to `.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml`
3. Add hook to `.pre-commit-config-quality.yaml`
4. Update documentation
5. Set appropriate thresholds

### Monitoring Trends

1. Review weekly analysis reports
2. Check artifact storage for historical data
3. Compare metrics over time
4. Identify areas needing attention
5. Plan refactoring efforts

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- Run local checks before pushing
- Fix issues incrementally
- Use verbose mode to understand failures
- Update baselines only when quality improves
- Document why you update baselines
- Review weekly reports for trends

### Don'ts ❌

- Don't skip pre-commit without good reason
- Don't update baselines to "make CI pass"
- Don't ignore security warnings
- Don't commit without running checks
- Don't disable checks without discussion

## Troubleshooting

### "Pre-commit hooks are slow"

Switch to standard config for regular commits:
```bash
git checkout .pre-commit-config.yaml
pre-commit install --force
```

### "False positive in security scan"

Add to ignore patterns in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.qontinui-devtools.security]
ignore_patterns = ["*/specific_file.py"]
```

### "Workflow fails on dependencies"

Check that qontinui-devtools installs correctly:
```bash
pip install qontinui-devtools
qontinui-devtools --version
```

### "Type coverage seems incorrect"

Verify mypy configuration:
```bash
mypy --config-file=pyproject.toml src/
```

## Success Metrics

### Short-term (1-3 months)

- ✅ Zero new circular dependencies
- ✅ No increase in critical god classes
