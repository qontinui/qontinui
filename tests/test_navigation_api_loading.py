"""Test that navigation_api successfully loads state structure from configuration.

This test verifies that the qontinui library can:
1. Load states from a configuration file
2. Load transitions between states
3. Initialize the navigation system properly
4. Activate initial states
5. Register states and transitions with the multistate adapter
