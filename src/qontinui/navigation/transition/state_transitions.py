class StateTransitions:
    """Container for all transitions associated with a specific State.

    Port of StateTransitions from Qontinui framework class.

    StateTransitions is a key component of the state structure (Î©), defining the edges
    in the state graph that enable navigation between GUI configurations. It encapsulates
    both incoming transitions (how to finalize arrival at this state) and outgoing
    transitions (how to navigate from this state to others).

    Transition types:
    - Transition Finish: Actions performed when arriving at this state from another
      state, ensuring the GUI is in the expected configuration
    - Outgoing Transitions: Collection of transitions that can navigate from this
      state to other states in the application

    Key features:
    - Supports multiple transition types (Python functions, Task sequences)
    - Handles state visibility control during transitions
    - Enables dynamic path finding by providing transition options
    - Maintains bidirectional navigation information

    In the model-based approach, StateTransitions transform implicit navigation knowledge
    into explicit, executable paths through the GUI. This enables the framework to automatically
    find routes between states and recover from unexpected situations by recalculating paths.
