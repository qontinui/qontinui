    WorkflowParser handles building the workflow_map dictionary that enables
    fast lookup of workflows by ID during execution.

    Example:

        >>> login_workflow = workflow_map["login_wf"]

        Creates a dictionary mapping workflow IDs to Workflow objects for
        efficient lookup during transition execution.

            workflows: List of Workflow objects from configuration.
