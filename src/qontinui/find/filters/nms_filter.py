    Removes overlapping matches by calculating Intersection over Union (IoU)
    and suppressing matches that overlap above a threshold with higher-scoring
    matches.

    The algorithm:
    1. Sort matches by similarity score (descending)
    2. Keep the highest-scoring match
    3. For each remaining match:
       - Calculate IoU with all kept matches
       - If IoU > threshold with any kept match, discard it
       - Otherwise, keep it

        >>> filter = NMSFilter(iou_threshold=0.3)
