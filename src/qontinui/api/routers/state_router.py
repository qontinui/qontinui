"""State management endpoints.

This router provides statechart management endpoints:
- Execute transition
- Navigate to states
- Get active states
- Get available transitions

All state management is delegated to ExecutionManager, which delegates to StateExecutionAPI.
REST layer never touches state directly.

NO backward compatibility - clean FastAPI code.
