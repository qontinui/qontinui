    Port of ActionService from Qontinui framework.

    ActionService acts as a factory that examines ActionConfig and returns
    the appropriate ActionInterface implementation. It intelligently routes
    between basic and composite actions based on the complexity of the requested operation.

    - Multiple Find operations → Composite FIND action
    - Single Find operation → Basic FIND action
    - Other actions → Checks basic registry first, then composite

    This service encapsulates the complexity of action selection, allowing the
    framework to transparently handle both simple and complex operations through
    a uniform interface.
