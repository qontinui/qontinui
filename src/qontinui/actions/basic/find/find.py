    """Core pattern matching action that locates GUI elements on the screen.

    Port of Find from Qontinui framework class.

    Find is the fundamental action in Qontinui's visual GUI automation, implementing various
    pattern matching strategies to locate GUI elements. It embodies the visual recognition
    capability that enables the framework to interact with any GUI regardless of the underlying
    technology.

    Find strategies supported:
    - FIRST: Returns the first match found, optimized for speed
    - BEST: Returns the highest-scoring match from all possibilities
    - EACH: Returns one match per StateImage/Pattern
    - ALL: Returns all matches found, useful for lists and grids
    - CUSTOM: User-defined find strategies for special cases

    Advanced features:
    - Multi-pattern matching with StateImages containing multiple templates
    - Color-based matching using k-means profiles
    - Text extraction from matched regions (OCR integration)
    - Match fusion for combining overlapping results
    - Dynamic offset adjustments for precise targeting

    Find operations also handle non-image objects in ObjectCollections:
    - Existing Matches can be reused without re-searching
    - Regions are converted to matches for consistent handling
    - Locations provide direct targeting without pattern matching

    In the model-based approach, Find operations are context-aware through integration
    with StateMemory, automatically adjusting active states based on what is found. This
    enables the framework to maintain an accurate understanding of the current GUI state.
