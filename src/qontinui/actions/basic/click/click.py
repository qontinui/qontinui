    """Performs ATOMIC mouse click operations on GUI elements.

    Port of Click from Brobot framework class.

    Click is an ATOMIC action that only performs mouse clicks on locations. It does NOT
    search for images or patterns - that functionality is provided by Find or through
    action chaining when using convenience methods like Action.click(StateImage).

    This separation of concerns ensures:
    - Click remains a pure, atomic action
    - Complex behaviors are achieved through action composition
    - Each action has a single, well-defined responsibility

    Click targets supported:
    - Locations: Direct screen coordinates
    - Regions: Clicks at region center
    - Matches: Results from previous Find operations
    - NOT StateImages directly (use Find first or Action.click convenience method)

    Advanced features:
    - Multi-click support for double-clicks, triple-clicks, etc.
    - Configurable click types (left, right, middle button)
    - Batch clicking on multiple locations
    - Post-click mouse movement to avoid hover effects
    - Precise timing control between clicks
