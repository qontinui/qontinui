    """Types text to the window in focus in the Qontinui model-based GUI automation framework.

    Port of TypeText from Qontinui framework class.

    TypeText is a fundamental action in the Action Model (Î±) that enables keyboard input
    simulation. It bridges the gap between high-level text input requirements and low-level
    keyboard event generation, providing a reliable way to enter text into GUI applications
    regardless of their underlying technology.

    Key features:
    - Focus-based Input: Types to whatever window or field currently has focus,
      following standard GUI interaction patterns
    - Configurable Timing: Supports custom delays between keystrokes to accommodate
      different application response times
    - Batch Processing: Can type multiple strings in sequence with configurable
      pauses between them
    - State-aware: Works with StateString objects that maintain context about
      their owning states

    Common use cases:
    - Filling form fields during automated testing
    - Entering search queries or commands
    - Providing credentials during login sequences
    - Interacting with text-based interfaces or terminals

    The type delay mechanism is particularly important for handling applications that
    process keystrokes asynchronously or have input validation that runs between keystrokes.
    By adjusting the type delay through ActionOptions, automation scripts can adapt to
    different application behaviors without modifying the core logic.

    This action exemplifies the framework's approach to abstracting platform-specific
    details while providing fine-grained control when needed. The underlying implementation
    delegates to platform-specific wrappers while maintaining a consistent interface.
