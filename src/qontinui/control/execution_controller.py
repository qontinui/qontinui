class ExecutionController(Protocol):
    """Interface for controlling the execution flow of automation tasks.

    Port of ExecutionController from Qontinui framework interface.

    Provides methods to pause, resume, and stop execution, as well as
    query the current execution state.

    This interface is the core contract for implementing execution control
    throughout the Qontinui framework. It enables fine-grained control over
    automation execution, allowing for interactive debugging, user intervention,
    and graceful shutdown.

    Key features:
    - Thread-safe pause/resume mechanism
    - Graceful stop with cleanup support
    - State query methods for UI integration
    - Checkpoint support for pause points

    Implementation requirements:
    - All methods must be thread-safe
    - State transitions must be atomic
    - Pause should block execution until resumed
    - Stop should allow for cleanup operations
