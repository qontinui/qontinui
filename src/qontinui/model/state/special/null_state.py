class NullState:
    """Special state for handling stateless objects in the framework.

    Port of NullState from Qontinui framework class.

    NullState provides a container for objects that don't belong to any specific state
    in the application's state graph. It enables the framework to process temporary or
    standalone objects using the same action infrastructure designed for state-based
    automation, maintaining consistency in how all objects are handled.

    Key characteristics:
    - Stateless Context: Objects belong to no particular application state
    - No State Activation: Finding these objects doesn't trigger state changes
    - Temporary Objects: Typically used for transient elements or utilities
    - Repository Exclusion: Should not be stored in the state repository
    - Action Compatibility: Can be acted upon like any other state object

    Common use cases:
    - Processing temporary dialogs or notifications
    - Handling utility objects that appear across multiple states
    - Working with objects during state transitions
    - Testing individual patterns without state context
    - Operating on objects before state structure is established

    Design pattern benefits:
    - Enables uniform object handling regardless of state association
    - Simplifies action implementation by avoiding null checks
    - Provides clear semantic meaning for stateless operations
    - Maintains type safety in the state system

    Implementation notes:
    - Contains a single State instance named "null"
    - Implements StateEnum through the Name enum for type compatibility
    - Should be used sparingly - most objects should belong to states
    - Not a singleton to allow multiple contexts if needed
