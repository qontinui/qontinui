    """Represents the initial uncertain state in the state management system.

    Port of UnknownState from Qontinui framework class.

    UnknownState serves as the universal entry point and recovery mechanism in the
    model-based automation framework. When the system starts or loses track of the current
    application state, it begins in the Unknown state. This state acts as a safety net,
    ensuring the automation can always recover from unexpected situations and navigate
    back to known states.

    Key characteristics:
    - Universal Entry: Default starting state for all automations
    - Recovery Point: Fallback when state detection fails
    - No Prerequisites: Always accessible regardless of application state
    - Transition Hub: Should have paths to major application states
    - Error Resilient: Handles unexpected application conditions

    Common scenarios leading to Unknown state:
    - Initial automation startup
    - Application crash or restart
    - Unexpected popups or dialogs
    - Network errors disrupting navigation
    - State detection confidence below threshold
    - Manual intervention during automation

    Best practices for Unknown state transitions:
    - Include paths to main menu or home screens
    - Add error dismissal actions (close dialogs, alerts)
    - Implement application restart procedures
    - Use robust visual patterns that work across contexts
    - Consider multiple recovery strategies

    Example recovery strategies:
    - ESC key to close potential dialogs
    - Alt+F4 to close unknown windows
    - Click on application icon to ensure focus
    - Navigate to known URL or home screen
    - Use keyboard shortcuts to reach main menu
