class StateTransition(ABC):
    """Core interface for state transitions.

    Port of StateTransition from Qontinui framework interface.

    StateTransition defines the contract for all transition types in the state graph,
    enabling polymorphic handling of different transition implementations. It represents
    the edges in the state structure (Î©) that enable navigation between GUI configurations,
    supporting both programmatic (Python code) and declarative (TaskSequence) transitions.

    Transition implementations:
    - TaskSequenceStateTransition: Data-driven transitions using action sequences
    - CodeStateTransition: Code-based transitions using callable functions

    Key properties:
    - Activation States: Set of states that this transition activates (navigates to)
    - Exit States: Set of states that are exited when this transition executes
    - Visibility Control: Determines if the source state remains visible after transition
    - Score: Path-finding weight (higher scores discourage using this transition)
    - Success Tracking: Count of successful executions for reliability metrics

    Visibility behavior (StaysVisible):
    - NONE: Inherit visibility behavior from StateTransitions container
    - TRUE: Source state remains visible after transition
    - FALSE: Source state becomes hidden after transition

    Path-finding integration:
    - Score affects path selection - lower total path scores are preferred
    - Success count can inform reliability-based path selection
    - Multiple activation targets enable branching transitions

    In the model-based approach, StateTransition abstracts the mechanism of state
    navigation while preserving essential metadata for intelligent path selection. The
    polymorphic design allows mixing declarative and programmatic transitions within
    the same state graph, providing maximum flexibility for different automation scenarios.
