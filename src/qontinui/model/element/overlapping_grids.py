class OverlappingGrids:
    """Creates two offset grids that overlap to provide comprehensive coverage.

    Port of OverlappingGrids from Qontinui framework class.

    OverlappingGrids addresses a common challenge in grid-based GUI automation: elements
    that span cell boundaries or are positioned at cell intersections. By creating two grids
    offset by half a cell width and height, this class ensures that any element in a
    grid-based layout falls clearly within at least one cell, improving targeting accuracy.

    Grid configuration:
    - Primary Grid: Original grid aligned with the region
    - Inner Grid: Offset by half cell dimensions in both directions
    - Same cell dimensions for both grids
    - Inner grid is smaller due to half-cell borders

    Problem scenarios solved:
    - Icons positioned at cell boundaries
    - UI elements that span multiple cells
    - Click targets at grid intersections
    - Partially visible elements at grid edges
    - Misaligned content in imperfect grids

    Common applications:
    - Desktop icon grids with large icons
    - Game boards where pieces sit on intersections
    - Tile-based maps with overlapping elements
    - Menu grids with hover effects extending beyond cells
    - Calendar interfaces with multi-day events

    Coverage guarantee:
    - Any point in the original region is covered by at least one cell
    - Most points are covered by cells from both grids
    - Elements at boundaries are fully contained in at least one cell
    - Reduces click accuracy issues near cell edges

    Example - Desktop icons at cell boundaries:
        # Original grid might split an icon between cells
        desktop = GridBuilder() \\
            .set_region(desktop_region) \\
            .set_columns(8) \\
            .set_rows(6) \\
            .build()

        # Overlapping grids ensure each icon falls within a cell
        overlap = OverlappingGrids(desktop)
        all_cells = overlap.get_all_regions()
