    Calculate similarity between images with mask support.

    This calculator compares two images pixel-by-pixel, considering optional
    masks that define active regions. The similarity score ranges from 0.0
    (completely different) to 1.0 (identical).

    The calculation:
    1. Validates that images have compatible shapes
    2. Applies masks to both images (only active pixels are compared)
    3. Calculates normalized pixel differences
    4. Returns weighted similarity score

    Constants:
        PIXEL_MAX_VALUE: Maximum pixel value for normalization (255.0)
        MASK_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD: Threshold for considering a mask pixel active (0.5)
