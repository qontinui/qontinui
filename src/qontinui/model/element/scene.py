@dataclass
class Scene:
    """Represents a captured screenshot or screen state as a searchable pattern.

    Port of Scene from Qontinui framework class.

    Scene encapsulates a full or partial screenshot that serves as a reference
    image for pattern matching operations. Unlike individual Pattern objects that
    typically represent specific UI elements, a Scene captures a broader view of
    the application state, providing context for finding multiple patterns within
    a single screen capture.

    Key characteristics:
    - Screenshot Storage: Holds a complete or partial screen capture
    - Pattern Container: Wraps the screenshot as a searchable Pattern
    - Persistent Identity: Maintains database ID for tracking and logging
    - Context Provider: Offers broader view than individual elements

    Common use cases:
    - Storing reference screenshots for state verification
    - Creating mock environments from captured scenes
    - Analyzing screen layouts and element positions
    - Debugging by comparing expected vs actual scenes
    - Building training data for pattern recognition
