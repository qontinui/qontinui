class EmptyMatch:
    """Represents the absence of a match.

    Port of EmptyMatch from Qontinui framework class.

    EmptyMatch is a specialized Match that explicitly represents failed search operations.
    Rather than using null values or empty results, EmptyMatch provides a concrete object that maintains
    the Match interface while clearly indicating that no visual element was found. This approach
    follows the Null Object pattern, enabling cleaner code without null checks.

    Key characteristics:
    - Zero Score: Always has a match score of 0 indicating no similarity
    - Empty Region: Contains a 0x0 region at position (0,0)
    - Named Identity: Carries "no match" as its identifying name
    - Valid Object: Can be used in all contexts expecting a Match

    Benefits of EmptyMatch pattern:
    - Eliminates null pointer exceptions in match processing
    - Enables uniform handling of successful and failed searches
    - Provides context about what was searched even when nothing was found
    - Simplifies conditional logic in automation scripts

    Use cases:
    - Representing failed Find operations without using null
    - Placeholder in collections when some searches fail
    - Default values in match-based data structures
    - Testing and mock scenarios requiring explicit non-matches
