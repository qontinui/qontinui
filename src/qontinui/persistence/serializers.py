    Pickle is inherently insecure when loading untrusted data. This serializer

    Safe usage:
    - Saving/loading Qontinui-generated state files
    - Files stored in project-controlled directories
    - Local file system with appropriate permissions

    Unsafe usage (DO NOT):
    - Loading files from network sources
    - Loading user-uploaded files
    - Loading files from shared/world-writable directories
    - Any file that could be modified by untrusted parties

    For untrusted data exchange, use JsonSerializer instead.
    See docs/SECURITY.md for comprehensive security guidance.
