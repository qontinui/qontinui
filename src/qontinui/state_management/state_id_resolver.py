    Port of StateIdResolver from Qontinui framework class.

    StateIdResolver handles the critical task of converting state names (used in code
    for readability) to state IDs (used internally for efficient processing). This service
    specifically processes StateTransitions objects to replace human-readable state names
    with their corresponding numeric identifiers.

    Key responsibilities:
    - Convert state names to IDs within StateTransitions objects
    - Process CodeStateTransition activate lists to resolve state names
    - Perform batch conversion during application initialization

    This service is essential for the model-based approach as it bridges the gap between
    human-readable state definitions and machine-efficient state processing, ensuring both
    developer productivity and runtime performance.

        efficient numeric comparisons during runtime while allowing developers
        to define states using meaningful names.

        1. Convert the parent state name to ID if not already set
        2. For CodeStateTransition objects, convert activate state names
        3. Build parallel lists of state IDs for runtime use
