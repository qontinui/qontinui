class AdjacentStates:
    """Discovers states reachable through direct transitions.

    Port of AdjacentStates from Qontinui framework class.

    AdjacentStates is a critical component in the framework's State Structure (S),
    responsible for identifying which states can be reached through single transitions from
    the current position in the GUI. This forms the basis for local navigation decisions
    and helps build the state graph dynamically during automation execution.

    Key features:
    - Transition Analysis: Examines StateTransitions to find reachable states
    - Static Transition Support: Identifies states with defined activation methods
    - Hidden State Handling: Manages PREVIOUS state expansion to hidden states
    - Multi-State Processing: Can process single states or sets of states

    Adjacent state discovery process:
    1. Retrieve all transitions defined for the source state
    2. Filter transitions that have activation methods (non-empty activate list)
    3. Extract target state IDs from these transitions
    4. Handle special PREVIOUS state by expanding to hidden states
    5. Return the complete set of reachable states

    Special handling for PREVIOUS state:
    - PREVIOUS is a special state representing "go back" functionality
    - When PREVIOUS is adjacent, it's replaced with actual hidden states
    - Hidden states represent the concrete states that "back" would navigate to
    - This enables proper pathfinding through back navigation

    Use cases:
    - Building local state graphs for pathfinding algorithms
    - Determining available navigation options from current position
    - Validating transition definitions during state model construction
    - Supporting breadth-first search in state space exploration

    In the model-based approach, AdjacentStates provides the foundation for understanding
    the local connectivity of the state graph. Unlike process-based automation that follows
    fixed scripts, this component enables dynamic discovery of navigation possibilities,
    allowing the framework to adapt to GUI variations and find alternative paths when needed.

    The ability to discover adjacent states dynamically is crucial for:
    - Recovering from unexpected GUI states
    - Finding optimal navigation paths
    - Adapting to application updates that change navigation flow
    - Building resilient automation that handles GUI variations
