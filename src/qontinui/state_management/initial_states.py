class InitialStates:
    """Manages probabilistic initial state discovery.

    Port of InitialStates from Qontinui framework class.

    InitialStates implements a sophisticated probabilistic approach to establishing the
    starting position in the GUI state space. Rather than assuming a fixed starting point,
    it maintains a weighted set of possible initial state configurations and uses intelligent
    search strategies to determine which states are actually active when automation begins.

    Key features:
    - Probabilistic State Sets: Associates probability weights with potential state combinations
    - Intelligent Search: Searches only for likely states, avoiding costly full scans
    - Mock Support: Simulates initial state selection for testing without GUI interaction
    - Fallback Strategy: Searches all states if no predefined sets are found
    - Recovery Capability: Can re-establish position when automation gets lost

    State selection process:
    1. Define potential initial state sets with probability weights
    2. In mock mode: Randomly select based on probability distribution
    3. In normal mode: Search for states in order of likelihood
    4. If no states found: Fall back to searching all known states
    5. Update StateMemory with discovered active states

    Probability management:
    - Each state set has an integer probability weight (not percentage)
    - Weights are cumulative for random selection algorithm
    - Higher weights indicate more likely initial configurations
    - Sum can exceed 100 as these are relative weights, not percentages

    Use cases:
    - Starting automation from unknown GUI position
    - Handling multiple possible application entry points
    - Recovering from navigation failures or unexpected states
    - Testing automation logic with simulated state configurations
    - Supporting applications with variable startup sequences

    Example usage:
        # Define possible initial states with probabilities
        initial_states.add_state_set(70, "LoginPage")  # 70% chance
        initial_states.add_state_set(20, "Dashboard")  # 20% chance
        initial_states.add_state_set(10, "MainMenu")   # 10% chance

        # Find which states are actually active
        initial_states.find_initial_states()

    In the model-based approach, InitialStates embodies the framework's adaptability to
    uncertain starting conditions. Unlike rigid scripts that assume fixed entry points,
    this component enables automation that can begin from various GUI positions and
    intelligently determine its location before proceeding with tasks.

    This probabilistic approach is essential for:
    - Web applications with session-based navigation
    - Desktop applications with persistent state
    - Mobile apps with deep linking or notifications
    - Any GUI where the starting position varies
