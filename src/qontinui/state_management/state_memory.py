    """Maintains the runtime memory of active States.

    Port of StateMemory from Qontinui framework class.

    StateMemory is a critical component of the State Management System (Î¼), responsible
    for tracking which states are currently active in the GUI. It serves as the framework's
    working memory, maintaining an accurate understanding of the current GUI configuration
    throughout automation execution.

    Key responsibilities:
    - Active State Tracking: Maintains a set of currently visible/active states
    - State Transitions: Updates active states as the GUI changes
    - Match Integration: Adjusts active states based on what is found during Find operations
    - State Probability: Manages probability values for mock testing and uncertainty handling
    - Visit Tracking: Records state visit counts for analysis and optimization

    Special state handling:
    - PREVIOUS: References states that are currently hidden but can be returned to
    - CURRENT: The set of currently active states
    - EXPECTED: States anticipated to become active after transitions
    - NULL State: Ignored in active state tracking as it represents stateless elements

    In the model-based approach, StateMemory bridges the gap between the static state
    structure and the dynamic runtime behavior of the GUI. It enables the framework to
    maintain context awareness, recover from unexpected situations, and make intelligent
    decisions about navigation and action execution.
