## Notes for Development Stage

This library is in **active development** with frequent breaking changes. Implementation summaries and completion documents have been intentionally excluded from version control since they:
- Quickly become outdated as the codebase evolves
- Add noise to the repository during rapid iteration
- Will be added back when the library reaches a stable release

See `CLAUDE.md` for the development philosophy.
